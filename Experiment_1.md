# EXPERIMENT - 1

## Design 1


### AIM:
To do the DC analysis,Transient and AC analysis of a CS amplifier circuit and extract the various parameters associated using LT Spice.

### COMPONENTS REQUIRED:

N Mosfet(nmos4 ,pmos4 ), Resistor(22k), voltage supply(1.8V,0.9V) and connecting wires.

### THEORY:
Mostfet is one of the most important compontent in electronics .

This importance is due to the fact of its compact design , low power consumption ,simple geometry and compatibilty in VLSI technology.

There are three different configurations in which the mosfet can be connected (namely common drain,gate and source) the most popular being common source and common drain configurations.

The Mosfet acts as an amplifier in the saturation region of operation where Vgs > Vth,Vgd < Vth and Vds>=Vov for an N channel mosfet. In the common source configuration there is a 180 degree phase shift between input and output.
There is very high input impedance (Ig=0) ideally infinite.

The drain current
Id = 1/2*kn*(Vov)^2 ; Vov=Vgs-Vth and kn=un*Cox*(W/L)

Output is taken from the drain end rather than simply across the resistor to maintain the common ground referance.

### DC Analysis:
This is done ensure the mosfet operates in saturation and to calculate the DC operationg point of the transistor. This prevents signal distortion .
This helps in the determination of the biasing resistors.
This helps in getting a correct operating point despite the fluctuation in the other parameters.

### Transient Analysis:
This to done to analyse the response of the circuit to time varying signals.

This is helpful to determine the signl distorton, DC shift between the input and the output. This plays key role in detecting issues like phase distortion.This is essential for high speed applications like communication systems.

### AC Analysis:

This is nothing but the small signal analysis of the circuit.This is done to determine the Gain of the amplifier circuit.
This also helps to analyze the Frequency Reponse of the amplifier circuit. the gain is given by Av = -gm Rd
